## Arrays

## Key Points to Solving Arrays
1. Take advantage of the fact that you can operate efficiently on both ends.
2. Array problems often have simple brute-force solutions that use O(n) space but sometimes need reduce space complexity to O(1).
3. Instead of deleting an entry (which requires O(n-1) time), consider overwriting it.
