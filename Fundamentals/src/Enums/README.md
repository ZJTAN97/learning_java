# Enums

- Short for enumerations, which means "specifically listed"

<br>

# Difference between Enums and Classes

- Like a `class`, has attributes and methods
- But Enum constants are public, static and final (unchangeable, cannot be overridden).
- Enum cannot be used to create objects and cannot extend other classes but can implement interfaces.

<br>

# When and why use Enums?

- Use enums when you have values that you know are not going to change. (month, days, colors, countries etc.)
