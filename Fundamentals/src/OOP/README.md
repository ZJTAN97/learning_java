This Java OOP concepts is based on what I learnt from geeks for geeks

Main OOPs Concepts
1. Class
2. Object 
3. Method and method passing
4. Pillars of OOPS
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
        - Compile-time polymorphism
        - Run-time polymorphism


Pillar 1: Abstraction
- Data Abstraction is the property by virtue of which only the essential details are displayed to the user.The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user. 
  Ex: A car is viewed as a car rather than its individual components.

Pillar 2: Encapsulatoin
- It is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. 
- Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.

Pillar 3: Inheritence
- Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in java by which one class is allow to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. 

Pillar 4: Polymorphism
- It refers to the ability of OOPs programming languages to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently. This is done by Java with the help of the signature and declaration of these entities.
