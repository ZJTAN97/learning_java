## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three main folders within `src`, where:

- `basics`: Contains the basic Java Syntax, arrays, logicals and loops
- `classes`: Contains classes topic on W3Schools (will clean up in future.)
- `intermediate`: Contains OOP concepts, constructors Methods, Java Collections 

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
