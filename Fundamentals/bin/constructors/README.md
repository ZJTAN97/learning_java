How are constructors different from methods in Java?
- Constructors must have the same name as the class within which it is defined while it is not necessary for the method in java.
- Constructors do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
- Constructors are called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any number of time.


Rules for writing constructor
- Constructor(s) of a class must have the same name as the class name in which it resides.
- A constructor in Java can not be abstract, final, static and Synchronized.
- Access modifiers can be used in constructor declaration to control its access i.e which other class can call the constructor.
