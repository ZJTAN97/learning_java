## Object Oriented Programming

### 1. Access Modifiers
In Java there are 4 types of access specifiers.
1. `public`: accessible in all class in your applications
2. `protected`: accessible within the package in which it is defined and its subclasses.
3. `private`: accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
4. `default`: accessible within same class and package within which its class is defined.
