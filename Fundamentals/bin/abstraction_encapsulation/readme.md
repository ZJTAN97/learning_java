## Abstraction
- Displaying only the essential details to the user.
- In Java, we can achieve abstraction via `interfaces` and `abstract classes`.

### Abstract Classes
When to use abstract classes and abstract methods?
- There are situations in which we will want to define a superclass that declares the structure of a given abstraction without providing a complete implementation of every method. That is, sometimes we will want to create a superclass that only defines a generalization form that will be shared by all of its subclasses, leaving it to each subclass to fill in the details.

### Advantages of Abstraction
1. Reduces complexity of viewing the things
2. Avoids code duplication and increases reusability
3. Helps to increase the security of an application or program as only important details are provided to the user.



## Encapsulation
- Is data hiding (information hiding) while Abstraction is detailed hiding (implementation hiding).
- Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
